# AR-Practice

## Made with Unity 2020.3.1f1 


### How it works:
* Within the Assets folder there is an object called `Reference Image Library`. This is used to set what image is going to be used as a the marker for AR Object. For more information on seeing what kind of image is good for Image Tracker look at [scoring tool](https://github.com/JacksiroKe/arcoreimg).

* When creating your AR Scene, an AR Session Origin Object will be made. Add the Component `AR Tracked Image Manager`. Under Serialized Library inout the Reference Image Library.

* Look into [AR Foundation Documentation](https://docs.unity3d.com/Packages/com.unity.xr.arfoundation@3.0/manual/tracked-image-manager.html) for more.
